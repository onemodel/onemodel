      /* ***************************
      (Idea to fix) FOR SOME REASON, when running in the IDE (as opposed to running "om-expect-tests" or "oet" from the command-line), this class test fails
      with the following output, and I'm done spending time on figuring out why since I don't know that running this test in the IDE is a requirement anyway.
      I verified that the data is there, and that removing prior output or checks made no difference (so probably not a full buffer).
      (But note that for testing speed or to check a subset of the expect tests in the IDE, one can use the "testing_newest_code_only" part of first.exp.)
      The output is:
