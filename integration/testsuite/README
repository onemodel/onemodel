This directory is for dejagnu (expect) tests, mainly intended for testing the Text UI / controller / menu features that did not seem to lend themselves to testing with testNG as easily as other classes did.

To run these tests, you can install dejagnu, cd into the testsuite directory, and run the program: runtest, or the convenience
script in the om project's core/bin/om-expect-tests (or its convenience helper, oet).  They are also run automatically by "mvn verify" (the failsafe plugin), by EntityMenuIT.java and probably others.

To run dejagnu tests in debug mode (to hit breakpoints in the IDE, for example), see at the top of first.exp, the comments around the variable "using_debugger".

For other convenience during development, see the next 2 variables immediately after that.

To reproduce dejagnu test problems in debug mode, you can call OM like:
  "om d x"
or
  "c d x"
...depending on which version of the variables is used at the top of the first.exp file.  See that file, and the ../core/bin/c and om scripts, for details.  Then when OM launches you can enter the test username and password (per the postgresql installation details you have probably already used, but as of 2017-7-31 the test user is "t1" and password is "x" (without quotes).  Then you can attach with a java debugger.  (As of 2017-7-31 it sometimes takes more than one run to get through all the breakpoints--failing with an expect error then getting beyond it the next time; I don't yet know why.).
