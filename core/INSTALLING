Compiling, Installing and Running OneModel
======================================================

This document assumes you know how to become root (or administrator) on
your system, edit files, and use a command prompt to change directories
and type commands.  Also, if you plan to compile OM yourself, that you
have downloaded and extracted, or git cloned, all the project files,
in a known directory location (such as ~/onemodel).

For convenience on Windows, you can install cygwin (www.cygwin.com),
then use cygwin to install postgresql and run the rest of the commands.
This hasn't been tested yet so please advise on what works & doesn't.

Downloading
-----------
You can get the .jar from here if you don't want to compile it:
www.onemodel.org .

Compiling
---------
Compiling before installing is optional, but developers should have java
& maven.

First you'll need a java SDK, at least openJDK 1.8 (likely minimum).  Then 
install maven (mvn).  These versions are known to work, on debian 8
(jessie) as of 2016-9:
    Apache Maven 3.0.5.
    Java version: OpenJDK 1.8.0_102.
...but other versions might work too.

Then in the directory where you have onemodel, run
  mvn clean package -DskipTests=true
...which builds the .jar -- but it can't run until the other steps below
are complete.


Installing
----------
(Note: wherever this document refers to documentation at postgresql.org,
remember you can check the specific document for your version by starting
at  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/ , or just change the provided link to
reflect your version, or find it.)

Before installing postgresql, decide whether you want data checksums
(checksums requires postgresql 9.3 or higher; I haven't tested with
checksums but they seem to provide a storage integrity feature).
If you do, you will need to take care of that yourself up front (these
instructions don't include that).  At:
  https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/What%27s_new_in_PostgreSQL_9.3#Data_Checksums
...we learn: "It is now possible for PostgreSQL to checksum data pages
and report corruption. This is a cluster-wide setting and cannot be
applied to individual databases or objects. Also be aware that this
facility may incur a noticeable performance penalty. This option must
be enabled during initdb and cannot be changed (although there is a new
GUC parameter 'ignore_checksum_failure' which will force PostgreSQL to
continue processing a transaction even if corruption is detected)."


Install postgresql (OM has been tested with 9.1, 9.3, and 9.4; see
www.postgresql.org).  For Debian GNU/Linux and its derivatives that
usually means (as root) running "aptitude install postgresql-contrib".
On OpenBSD that means running "pkg_add postgresql-contrib".  (The
postgresql contrib module is for the "large objects" support, aka a
module called "lo".)

There are additional steps to be performed from a command prompt:

- Make sure you have java in the path so you can run
    java
  ...and see a bunch of output about usage.  Otherwise see the java
  installation instructions for putting it in your path.


(OpenBSD instructions are further below.)

INITIAL POSTGRES CONFIGURATION UNDER LINUX:
- Become the root user (i.e., run "/bin/su -" and enter the root
password), then make a backup copy of and edit the file
    /etc/postgresql/9.4/main/pg_hba.conf
  (or its equivalent on your system).

- I commented out (with a # at the beginning of the line) all other lines
below "Put your actual configuration here" to limit other connections
to the system, and you may also want to do that, *except DO NOT change*
the one that says
    local   all             postgres
...which is required for administrative access.

- Add some configuration lines at the very end, or at least down after
where the file says "Put your actual configuration here", making sure
there were no conflicting lines above them.  Replace <username> with
the username you want to use to access your OneModel data (usually the
same as your username on the computer; I don't know if spaces will work
so omit them if your username has any):

#This works for postgresql 9.1 - 9.6, and probably higher:
host	om_<username>	<username>    127.0.0.1/32    md5
local	om_<username>	<username>    md5
host	om_testrunner	testrunner    127.0.0.1/32    password
local	om_testrunner	testrunner    password

  (Details for the interested:	There must be no conflicting lines above
  or below these, because when postgresql interprets the file there is
  no drop-through or default behavior, so the first matching line wins.
  ...but see the postgresql docs if you have specific configuration
  needs outside of what OM requires.  The "host" lines are necessary
  even if you are only using OM from your own computer, because of how
  jdbc makes connections.  More at:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/client-authentication.html

- Restart postgresql (as root: "/etc/init.d/postgresql restart").

- Become the user postgres with this:
    su - postgres



INITIAL POSTGRES CONFIGURATION UNDER OPENBSD, tested
with OpenBSD 5.7 and 5.8: --------------------------
(Corrections solicited as with everything here, but doing this with
OpenBSD seemed more complicated.)
As root, run commands one at a time (not as a script), reading each line fully first:
  chpass -s bash _postgresql  #Optional, for if you want that user to use bash. (You have to install bash first w/ "pkg_add bash", of course.)
  mkdir -p /var/log/postgresql
  chown -R _postgresql:_postgresql /var/log/postgresql
  /usr/bin/su - _postgresql
  echo 'umask 0077' >> .profile
  exit # to let the umask change take effect
  /usr/bin/su - _postgresql
  mkdir -p  /var/postgresql/9.4/main #BUT CHANGE THE '9.4' FOR your version of postgres! For example, no need to change if you have 9.4.4, but do change if you have 9.5, to say "9.5" instead of "9.4".
  echo "check permissions on those new directories: probably don't want group or world access.)";read
  cd 9.4/main  #BUT CHANGE THE '9.4' FOR your version of postgres!
  /usr/local/bin/initdb --pgdata /var/postgresql/9.4/main/ #BUT CHANGE THE '9.4' FOR your version of postgres!
  cp -p pg_hba.conf pg_hba.conf-original

Then edit the file pg_hba.conf. Comment out all lines that are not already
commented out (there were 3), and put these 5 lines at the end, substituting
your username (the user that will use OM) for the 4 instances of <username>:

local	all		_postgresql	 peer
host	om_<username>	<username>    127.0.0.1/32    md5
local	om_<username>	<username>	  md5
host	om_testrunner	testrunner    127.0.0.1/32    password
local	om_testrunner	testrunner	password

  Make sure those 5 are the only un-commented lines, or that you
  understand the others and what they do & whether you want that.

  (Details for the interested:	There must be no conflicting lines
  above or below these, because when postgresql interprets the file
  there is no drop-through or default behavior, so the first matching
  line wins.  Also I commented out all other lines below "Put your actual
  configuration here" except the one that says
    local   all		    postgres
  ...but see the postgresql docs if you have specific configuration
  needs outside of what OM requires.  The "host" lines are necessary
  even if you are only using OM from your own computer, because of how
  jdbc makes connections.)

  Still as the user _postgresql, use commands like this, perhaps in a
  script, to start postgresql:
    pg_ctl start --pgdata /var/postgresql/9.4/main --log /var/log/postgresql/pg.log
    sleep 1
    ps auxww|grep postgres

  (I didn't use the /etc/rc.d/postgres script to start postgres,
  because it got errors like "/etc/rc.d/rc.subr: Permission denied",
  or when run as root it also failed saying it should have been run as
  the _postgresql user.)

  If ever needed, you can stop postgresql by running a command like
  this as root:
    sudo -u _postgresql /usr/local/bin/pg_ctl status -D /var/postgresql/9.4/main



CONTINUED POSTGRES CONFIGURATION FOR *BOTH* LINUX AND OPENBSD:
- At this point you should still be logged in to a command-line as the
postgres (or on BSD, _postgresql) user.

- Choose a username and password.  If you use the same username as
your system username, and password 'x' (without quotes) when setting the
password below, OM will log you in automatically. In many cases this
might be most convenient, especially if your operating system already
requires a password to log in under your own username.	If you choose a
different username, or a strong password (which is a good idea sometimes),
you will be prompted each time.
(Note: If needed, you can change your password later on, after completing
all below steps, then again become the postgres user as above and run this 
command, substituting your username for the "<...>", removing the <>'s):
    psql om_<yourusername>
...then:
    \password <yourusername>
...then follow the prompts to enter the new password twice.)

- Create the database with this command (substituting your username for
the "<...>", removing the <>'s):
    createdb om_<yourusername>

- run psql (the postgresql administrative application) like this:
    psql om_<yourusername>
  ...and you should see a prompt, something like this:
    $psql om_<yourusername>
    psql (9.4.5)
    Type "help" for help.
    om_<yourusername>=#

- At the prompt, run this command (substituting your username & password
for the "<...>"'s, removing the <>'s, but *do keep* the single-quotes
(') and the semicolon ";"):
    create role <yourusername> with createdb login encrypted password '<putYourPasswordHere>';
  ... but don't use any apostrophes, aka single-ticks or single-quotes
  inside your provided password, because it should only be surrounded
  by them.   Note it is NOT "create role om_<yourusername>": having om_
  at the beginning is just for when you refer to the databasename inside
  postgresql.

  (DEVELOPERS: during development or testing it might be convenient to
  use a password of 'x' as described above under "Choose a username and
  password", to avoid typing a longer password repeatedly, until you
  use real data; it can be changed with postgresql commands as described
  above, or you could set up a separate db/user/password combination for
  "real" data.)

- Developers: also run this command (with the semicolon):
    create role testrunner with createdb login encrypted password 'testrunner';
  ...which is to enable unit tests.

- Run this command (with the semicolon):
    create extension lo;
  ...which is to enable large objects support (ie to allow putting
  documents or other files in the database).  (This requires the "contrib"
  module installed above.)

- Run
    \q
  ...(and Enter) to exit psql.

- Developers: still as the postgres user, run the command:
    createdb om_testrunner --owner testrunner
  ...which is also to enable unit tests.

- Developers: re-enter psql as before but in the om_testrunner database
    psql om_testrunner
  ...and in it run the command:
    create extension lo;
  ...and
    \q
  ...to exit psql again.

- Everyone: Then run the command
    exit
  ... twice, to no longer be the postgres user or root.

The remaining database setup steps are performed by the OneModel
application when it is launched under your own user account.

In this setup you are responsible for local administration and backups,
using the postgresql documentation as needed; feel free to inquire on
the mailing list for more information.	(Developers: Using something
like AWS with more automation is a possible alternative.  Or maybe we
could just create a tarball and fully script all this, or a .deb that
does everything without need for manual setup.)


Verifying
---------
Developers: if you (checked out source and) installed maven (under
Compiling, above), you can:
  1) verify that the installation was successful
  by running this from the project directory:
    mvn clean test
  ...or if you change any code then instead run
    mvn clean package
  ...then make sure that was successful and no tests reported failure.

  2) Then also run integration tests (for Linux at least; details just below), 
     by:
    a) Installing dejagnu (details in the file core/testsuite/README).
    b) Making sure that the om core/bin directory is in the path, for running of
       scripts like "c" and "oet" etc. (Most of these scripts
       have only been written for Linux, and tested on Debian. For other 
       platforms,
       patches are welcome: pls see the file CONTRIBUTING and send in
       questions.)
    c) Make sure psql (from the postgreSQL installation) is in the path 
       (this is true by default on debian).
    d) Then you can run
         mvn verify
       ...which runs integration tests against the .jar file built above
       by "mvn clean package".


Running
-------
Just execute the jar with java.  An easy way is to go to the directory
where it is installed (such as ~/onemodel), then use a command line
similar to this for Linux/Unix:

  bin/om

...or for Windows (let me know if this works; feel free to fix it &
send a pull request):

  bin\om.bat


Usage Tips
----------
There is no substitute for making regular backups of all data that
matters to you.  (idea: fill in here the steps, or link to instructions,
for a postgresql backup? or suggest to go find that?)

You'll almost certainly want to have a long scrollback buffer in your
command window, for times when you just need to review the recent past,
or there was an errant keystroke and you want to see what happened.

If it ever crashes or you suspended it to the background with ^Z (which
as of this writing doesn't work), and you find you can't type anything
at all on the command-line, in the bash shell, you can run Ctrl-c then
the 'reset' command (even if you can't see what you're typing) and that
should fix it (by resetting the line editor at that bash prompt).

If you make some changes in subgroups, then ESCape back to a group
which suddenly doesn't look right (has too few entries or something),
then you can see the right entries by ESCaping from the incorrectly
displayed group then going back into it.  It's an infrequent bug.
If you learn a way to reproduce it consistently, let me know.

See the http://onemodel.org web site for the latest usage documentation.


Troubleshooting
---------------
Make sure you did everything above.  Triple-check it, really.

This happened once, only after a later postgresql version was installed
without fully removing the old version first:  in postgresql.conf I
had to change the port from 5433 to 5432 (on openbsd, that would mean
first copying the file from the examples directory; see above for
other such files copied for mor info).	It probably was set to 5433
on installation because I still had the config files on disk from the
earlier installation, so it used the next available port.

Developers: Try running 'mvn clean'.  Or starting from scratch with
the instructions.

It seems unlikely, but on some systems you might have to open port 5432
for postgresql on a firewall.  If this is true you probably already know.

Whatever else you learn to fix, send a message to the mailing list,
or better yet a pull request with the information.

Developers: If you're having problems with aspects (e.g., excessive
debugging output, no debugging output, or error messages on launch about a
missing method), then edit .aj files as needed, and you might have to run
'mvn clean' (to remove what was there), then run "mvn package" *twice*
(to reinstate aspect code as written) for reasons not yet investigated.
The script /bin/c might make this convenient.  See the comments in the
file 'pom.xml' for more info (search it for 'aspect').

If anyone works interactively with the same postgresql instance as is
used for your OneModel installation, and OneModel seems to hang (freeze),
see if someone has left a transaction uncommitted.

If something really annoying happens (due to some bug) and you can't
get out, you can always ^C and go back in (and report what happened,
exact details of all messages, and how to consistently reproduce it).


Notes On Development Setup
--------------------------
I'm using IntelliJ again now instead of Eclipse, since I couldn't get some
features to work with eclipse (of 2 scala files, in one of them things
worked, in the other code completion, auto-formatting, most refactoring,
and syntax error highlighting didn't work; couldn't run test files in
the debugger, nor evaluate expressions.)  Seems to be much better.

How I got IntelliJ working for this project (no previous settings):
  Installed (then) IntelliJ IDEA v. 13.1.5, already having OpenJDK 1.7,
  and launch it.

  Select "open new project" (NOT import, that had more problems)
    find the pom.xml file for OM, highlight, click OK

  Choose File,settings,plugins,(lowerRH button) Browse..., right-click
  scala (in list), choose dnload/install, close.

  Wait for installation to complete, then restart IntelliJ

  Go to File / project structure (like proj settings, ctrl+alt+shift+s),
  and:
    - fill in the JDK
    - add scala facet (click it, then +, ... dbl-click the proj name or
    whatever in dialog not just hit OK )
    - click 'Libs' on LH, then + to add lib dir from the scala
    installation directory
    - click 'Modules' on LH, then 'Paths' tab in center top, then
    make sure the radio button "Inherit project compile output path"
    is checked.

  Accept option to enable type-aware highlighting (or yelo/grn "[ ]"
  thing in lower RH status bar, or ctrl+shift+alt+E).

  Open some file like textui.scala.

  Right-click in the editor and choose mvn / reimport (this may have
  since moved to a circle-like icon on the far right side of the IDE).

Notes on how I previously had Eclipse set up are in an older version of
this file, in git.

CUSTOMIZE the IDE.  At least set tabs to spaces, size 2.

I put my typical mvn commands in scripts so I can invoke them from
the command-line with just one or two letters; in bash that is always
starting with the line "#!/bin/bash -eux" (or the 2nd line being "set
-eux"), where the "-eu" is so the script will fail immediately on any
errors instead of continuing in error.

If you still see errors/warnings that the IDE is not finding things in
the path, confirm it works from the command-line ('mvn' commands found
in INSTALLING) before you decide the project is broken. There's something
different w/ your configuration.

I tried fsc but it was slower by 1/3 (15s in the ide) or got many compile
errors (from CLI: "mvn clean scala:cc -Donce=true -Dfsc=true"); if you
know why I'd like to hear.  Maybe it would work if switched from mvn
to SBT.
