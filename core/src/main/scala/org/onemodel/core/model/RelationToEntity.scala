 * Represents one RelationToEntity object in the system (usually [always, as of 9/2003] used as an attribute on a Entity).
 *
 * The intent of this being "abstract protected..." is to help make it so the class is only visible to (or at least only used by) its subclasses, so
 * that everywhere else has to specify whether the usage is a RelationToLocalEntity or RelationToRemoteEntity.  Only got partway there with the compiler
 * though; still had to search & fix others.
 *
 * You can use Entity.addRelationTo[Local|Remote]Entity() to create a new object.
