# The previous line is more portable than /bin/bash or /usr/local/bin/bash .  Possible 
# alternatives, if tested & working on all of dash, ksh, and bash (ie, debian,

#!/bin/sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
# But note: the lines with "env" will fail if there is a trailing space or DOS-style line terminators.

#Idea: temporarily remove next line to help diagnosing why pg wont always restart after om rung 4 a while. The idea
#is to do "kill -3 <pid>" on each running process just before exiting OM, one at a time, to see if something in 
#the stack trace shows a transaction in use or such.
#reset #see cmt just below for why. If adapting for other OSes, make sure that cmd doesn't do something drastic. 

# Idea: put in a trap so ^C or ^Z gets handled right on those signals? (search 'man bash' for "times  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and for processes run from the shell",
# and then see 'trap' there):  Or just fix the behavior of the application by watching for those & resetting the terminal state propertly. But what about coming back to it after a ^Z?
echo "On unix, if the terminal is messed up now, you might have to blindly type (making sure the command line is clear first) "reset" and hit Enter.  Not usually, but there's a bug such that sometimes after ^Z or ^C it happens."
