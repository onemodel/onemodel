/**
 * Represents one RelationToRemoteEntity object in the system, used as an attribute on a Entity.
 *
 * RelationToLocalEntity and RelationToRemoteEntity in the db are separate due to needing a different column and different indexes.  And they are
 * also separate in the code to make it as clear as possible which logic is needed at a given time.
 *
 * This 1st constructor instantiates an existing object from the DB and is rarely needed. You can use Entity.addRelationTo[Local|Remote]Entity() to
 * create a new persistent record.
 *
   **NOTE**: it *yes does* make sense to instantiate a RelationToRemoteEntity with a db parameter being for a *local* (ex., postgresql) database,
   because the local db contains references to remote ones.  Then, when creating for example an Entity for a record at a remote site, that
   would have a db parameter which is remote (i.e., an instance of RestDatabase; see Entity.addRelationToRemoteEntity).

   *****  MAKE SURE  ***** that during maintenance, anything that gets data relating to mEntityId2 is using the right (remote) db!:
