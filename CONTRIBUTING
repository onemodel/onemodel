For code contributions, web site improvements, etc:  Please include
in the *first* commit comment of the first pull request (or
equivalent), the following statement with your name inserted in the
blank (if you are legally an adult, or with explicit included
guardian permission).  PLEASE SEE THE REASONS below, under the section
"DETAILS AND EXPLANATION ON COPYRIGHT ASSIGNMENT".  A nonbinding
summary could be:  "I give this to Luke for use in the project,
having full rights to do so; this also applies to all future
contributions, and is simple to revoke", but paste in the full text
between the lines and fill in your name, in this "OM contributor statement":
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    I, ______, being of legal age, certify, and take full responsibility for this
    certification, that I am authorized, without restriction
    of employer agreement or any other kind, to assign all rights to this 
    work (also known as "contribution"), and I do assign
    all rights to this work to Luke A. Call (all mentions of Luke A. Call here 
    also referring to his successors or assigns), who, by incorporating
    this work into the OneModel project, promises that this will promptly be 
    made publicly available under the license agreement
    under which the project is generally made available at that time, and also
    thereby grants back to me non-exclusive,
    royalty-free and non-cancellable rights to the work (i.e., this work, 
    changes or enhancements, not the program that they enhance), to do 
    as I see fit.  I understand that Luke A. Call may assign rights to other 
    entities or release this work under other
    licenses in the future, as seems to him best for the good of this project 
    and humankind as a whole.
    Any other future submissions or contributions by me of work to Luke A. Call 
    for use in the OneModel project will be under these same terms.  

    I may revoke this agreement by so stating in an email message (or 
    certified mail) to which I receive a reply or receipt, but 
    only with respect to work submitted after that time.  Luke A. Call 
    may revoke his participation in this agreement simply by removing 
    all such work or contribution in question from use by the OneModel project, 
    and/or by replacing it with other material.  After any revocation of this
    agreement, I will assert no related patent claims against the OneModel 
    project or Luke A. Call, even if similar code is subsequently added.

    Any legal contest around this agreement will be decided in and per the 
    laws of the State of Utah.  If a court declares any part of this agreement 
    invalid or ineffective, the remaining parts will remain in force.

    By incorporating the contribution Luke A. Call also agrees that: if he dies
    or becomes permanently incapacitated, and a new GNU AGPL is released by the
    Free Software Foundation, and neither he nor his successors or assigns 
    openly state his or their position on the new GNU AGPL within a year (in a 
    OneModel mailing list or similarly related and prominent forum), then the 
    project's source code will automatically fall under that new version 
    of the GNU AGPL, assuming it agrees in spirit with the GNU AGPL 
    version 3 from the Free Software Foundation.

OTHER WAYS TO HELP WITH THIS PROJECT:
- bug reports with the simplest
  viable and CLEAR instructions for reproducing the bug from the
  latest code.  (Some bugs are already known, so there's little need
  to re-report those.)
- supporting other users on project mailing lists etc,
  or helping someone you know.
- other suggestions, constructive feedback
- create good data and share it, such as around best
  practices on all subjects, integrated with maturity models (step-by-step
  learning/growth plans) for all areas of life, share ideas & discussion
  in that direction, or improve & extend the work of others.
- money

KEEP IN MIND: 
- See the README and the onemodel.org web site for
  project status; there is much to do.  In the future I hope to use
  OM itself to share plans, bug reports, etc.
- Other information about this project is at:
    http://www.onemodel.org
    http://www.github.com/onemodel/onemodel
    http://www.github.com/onemodel/onemodel-website
- I am / we are grateful for your participation!  It is very
  gratifying if this project is helpful.
- I have not seen value in the "tl;dr" ("too long, so didn't read") philosophy.
  Instead, I try to write in skimmable ways so you can read the beginning and
  ending, then if need more info read the first sentences of sections,
  first sentences of paragraphs, look for bold & caps, & read the
  rest if details would help.  Don't ask for an explanation if you
  won't read something where I already tried to save you time in writing.
- Search for the article "how to ask a question well" or
  some such, by Eric Raymond (ESR): very practical suggestions.
- Design reviews save time or avoid wasting time with an idea that
  can be readily improved with discussion.
- Failure isn't often failure, but how we learn and move forward.  
- Not hearing back is not an insult, it's just that people are sometimes busy with
  competing priorities.  If it's important, you could wait a few weeks and try
  again, perhaps with improvements.
- It's usually best to mimic the code style, etc, that is already in place.  And let's
  keep the scala code at a level that is generally easy to read (guessable) for a
  java programmer, or discuss making it that way if it isn't so now.  See
  updates to this page:  http://onemodel.org/1/e-9223372036854618069.html
  ...for current thoughts on scala style in OM, or ask on the mailing list.
- Let's have fewer build warnings rather than more.  
- Test well.  Consider the audience.  Be diligent at not introducing new bugs.
  Consider testing more than one facet of the program, in more than one way.
  Write automated tests; make sure to test all lines changed or
  impacted; use the changes personally for a while.
- There is currently a way to configure aspectj inside OM to provide very much
  debugging output, if that helps; it's roughly analogous to what "set -x"
  does in shell scripts.  See the comments in
  src/main/java/org/onemodel/MethodTracing.aj.
- Please forgive faults of others, and let's all keep trying to be good and
  helpful.


DETAILS AND EXPLANATION ON COPYRIGHT ASSIGNMENT:
- The FSF (Free Software Foundation, providers of the GNU toolchain and
  many very widely-used products) also requires copyright assignment, 
  and their process & forms, and the Harmony Project forms, are much 
  longer than this (more below).  
  So does Google, and their form is also longer and more detailed:
  https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual .
- This strives for a balance, between burdening the future with lack of
  preparation, vs. burdening the present with distraction and complication.
- The single biggest reason is to maintain
  the ability to make changes or manage the rights in the ways that
  make this project have the most benefit to mankind.  For viability,
  sometimes one has to make adjustments, in case,
  for example, it's time to move to a newer AGPL, but protecting 
  against someone subverting the FSF and making a bad newer
  AGPL.  Or, if we need to move some code to LGPL or BSD for an unforeseen
  reason, distribute under multiple licenses (like
  plantuml does), assign rights to a nonprofit (someday),
  dual licensing (what the FSF suggests
  as "selling exceptions" as a way to help fund the project), or
  whatever it takes to do make the project the most good for everyone overall.
  Other projects have had problems or burdens because they didn't get
  copyright assignment, like they needed to change the license but
  couldn't: arguably the linux kernel is one, mozilla another, and
  I'm confident there have been others about which I've read, such as in
  these discussions which show complexity of making changes without assignment:
    https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=17/03/24/0245240 
    https://news.slashdot.org/story/17/03/26/2258218/after-20-years-openssl-will-change-to-apache-license-20-seeks-past-contributors
  .
- It is easier to defend and enforce the freedoms in the license (e.g., the
  requirement that redistributors also provide source code, and probably easier
  to defent against patent trolls), if there is a single entity holding
  rights.  The FSF requests copyright assignment in GNU projects, for
  at least that reason. (References:
    [something at fsf.org explaining their own requests for copyright assignment.]
    https://www.fsf.org/news/android-termination-upgrade-gplv3
      ...which says "only copyright holders can enforce free software licenses
    in most countries" )
- I am not an attorney, & I often personally resent long
  (nonstandard) legal agreements.  (Their authors probably do not
  read long agreements themselves before clicking "I agree", and they
  don't seem to really expect you to read them as they're in a tiny
  window. hard to understand, and overcomplicated; and I've gathered
  that lawyers don't typically read their own mortgage agreements or
  EULAs they accept: which feels dishonest to me, as we should know
  what we promise and we should use the Golden Rule when asking others
  to promise!)  I try to avoid such messes, and just want us all to
  do the right thing and be helpful.  Maybe someday we'll have to do
  things the hard way (ie, decide what attorneys to trust with such
  tasks and how to pay and direct them etc etc), but let's avoid that
  as long as possible, right?
- Why the AGPL?  Because with the
  amount of work in this, if someone improves it for their own benefit,
  I'd like for everyone to get the benefit of the improvements.  The
  AGPL seems to provide the most benefit to the most people, which
  is the whole point.  If that bothers you, you probably haven't read
  much about the reasoning behind things like the AGPL:  Richard M
  Stallman & others give compelling arguments about freedom for the
  end-user vs. freedom for some to have power over others.  In many
  cases it seems most beneficial overall, if any user has the freedom
  to modify the software that they run, hire someone to do that, know
  for certain what the software is actually doing, and to share what
  they learn with others.  The AGPL preserves that freedom for any
  recipient of the software who so wishes; some other licenses allow
  loss of those end-user rights.  The AGPL also allows selling software
  etc to make a living, if one follows the license.  And, using the
  AGPL means there is less legal restriction on using other free
  libraries, in OM.

  http://www.tcpdump.org/license.html (they would change their license, but are
  not doing so, only because of the # of contributors they'd have to contact; I
  believe mozilla had to work through that issue, and I don't want to waste that much time.)
